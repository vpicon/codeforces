# Codeforces
This repository contains solutions to the competitive programming 
contests provided by [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

Contests are identified by Codeforces _round number_. Each contest
sits in its own directory by round number. The division number is 
formatted as `ROUND_NUMBER.div`, only if the division is not 1.
